    <title> States analysis</title>


    <h1><a href="https://www.Iowa.gov">Iowa 1.</a></h1>
    <p> Iowa's website was by far my favorite out of all the state run websites. It has a clean and modern look that draws me into wanting to explore. The layout and function of the navigation board is clean and fresh looking and the interaction between the user and the website is very good. The website does resize very well and works ok on a mobile device, however they do have a link to a mobile application for the site which would probably be the best for mobile users. The code from my perspective looks clean with more code than some of the other state websites. I did find a section in the code with a lot of numbers that did confuse me, however I beleive it is due to my lack of knowledge in coding. One other thing that I realy liked about Iowa's website was the inclusion of state facts and statistics related to citizens of the state. Overall Iowa is my favorite website because of its user friendly feel and also the modern look it brings to the table. </p>


    <h1> <a href="https://www.tennessee.gov">Tennessee 2.</a></h1>
    <p> Tennessee's state website compared to Iowa's website very well. It has a fresh and modern look with eye pleasing colors and navigation. It seems to work good with different screen sizes and loads very quickly. The navigation tools are laid out well and work good for the user that is trying to find something specific. Navigating I can find things easily and quickly. Upon looking at the code I still am confused on what some of it means but to my eyes it looks clean and well versed without and messy delitions still hanging around. I would name Tennessee my second place website under Iowa only because the website does not have as apeasing of a look and lacks state facts on the homepage. </p>




    <h1><a href="https://www.Vermont.gov">Vermont 3.</a> </h1>
    <p> Vermont brings to the table with its website a modern look and feel comparative to Tennessee and Iowa. The homepage is eye pleasing and one feature I found intersting that set itself apart from other websites is the inclusion of a news feed. I liked this feature and it seems to be very informative for users. It does fit and funciton well when the screen size is adjusted. Upon looking at the code thier is still alot of functions that I dont understand yet but to my eyes it seems pretty clean. The website loaded and function well and had overall good usability. I would have to rank it as my third favorite website. </p>



    <h1><a href="https://www.Oklahoma.gov">Oklahoma 4.</a></h1>
    <p> Like Iowa Oklahoma's website is fresh and modern looking with good usability. The drop down menu's are clean, modern looking and organized. The colors and design was not completly eye pleasing but adequate. Compared to Iowa's website the homepage is on the more barren side and the navagation on the home page is very simplistic and looks like something we could achomplish in class. However once you move out away from the homepage navigation becomes easier and a little more complex. It seems to work ok when talking about different screen size usage and does load quickly. Upon examining the code it falls somewere inbetween Alaka and Iowa on lenght and complexity. Overall Oklahoma had a soilid website that fell in the middele of the pack compared to the other state websites. </p>



    <h1><a href="https://www.alaska.gov">Alaska 5.</a></h1>

    <p>While examining the Alaska website I got the feeling that it is kind of an old setup. The rounded corners and overall website reminded me of a blockbuster video website. Overall the code for the site looks pretty clean and I wasnt able to identify any messy deletions that were still present. Another downside to the site is that it is completely not set up to be used on a mobile device. While on mobile it is very messy and the screen resizeing is pretty terrrible. One clean aspect of the site is the top navigation bar it is set up in a astheticly pleasing way and all of the links seem to work. Overall Alaska's state website was not my favorite but also not my least favorite. </p>
